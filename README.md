# ML-On-Prod

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning for production purposes. While not a full MLOps implementation, it incorporates key practices to ensure the model is scalable, reliable, and maintainable in production. For ease of control and development, the detailed code is placed in separate repos, links to each repo can be found in the attachments in the pdf file.
